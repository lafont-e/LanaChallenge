* As we don't have a database where to keep permanent information, we used global variable as an alternative, although global variables (an more in modules) are a bad programming practice, I'm aware of it, but this is a sample application only, so it makes no sense to define a database and use it.
* in discounts, the discount functions are hard coded BUT with a small change, they can be loaded dinamically at runtime if needed, just did not implement that way as it takes more effort
* the files promotions.json and products.json must be available at the same directory that the server application.

* Tickets has the followind public functions/methods
- NewTicket: returns a new ticket with the given promotions table
- Add: method that adds a line to the ticket
- Total: total value of the ticket 
- Status : status info of the ticket, used only to somwaht identify a ticket for the http server
- String : returns a string representing the ticket in print format
